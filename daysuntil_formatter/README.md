Create a custom block in code which will be displayed in the sidebar on the event page. The block should display how many days are left until the event starts, example: ‘12 days left until event starts’. If the event is going to happen on the current day display 'This event is happening today'. If the event has ended, display ‘This event already passed.’.

The block should not be cached.
